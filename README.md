# Intergrala

A little bit of Ruby and Python to render 3d models of a given function and calculate the volume of a solid that that function would create. We could never get it working off of anything but a local rack server or with shell method (as opposed to disk method) - if you'd like to check it out, clone the repo, and install python/ruby/rack.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'intergrala'
